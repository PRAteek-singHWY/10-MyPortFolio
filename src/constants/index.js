    ProblemsFaced: "Here, I dealt with a real-world React.js project for the first time after coming out of the world of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Three.js seemed a bit overwhelming at first, but the 3D aspect really excited me to develop this project. Here, I learned how to apply 2D images over 3D shapes using decals and many more things like the positioning of 3D models and playing with their placement and tilt effects. This entire experience has been amazing, and my tutor played a huge role in helping me learn and overcome challenges. ",

    ProblemsFaced: "During the development of this project, I encountered a challenge with the API. The API used in the tutorial was no longer available for free, so I had to find a suitable alternative using Rapid API. It was my first time working with a REST API, so I had to familiarize myself with the API structure and understand how to use the different API endpoints effectively. Despite the initial hurdle, I was able to create a better version of my application and gained valuable experience in working with API endpoints. Throughout the development process, the use of { console.log() } and { Chat-GPT's asistance }played crucial roles in my learning journey."
