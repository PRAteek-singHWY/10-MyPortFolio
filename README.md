My Experiences and Difficulties Faced :
Here, I dealt with a real-world React.js project for the first time after coming out of the world of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Three.js seemed a bit overwhelming at first, but the 3D aspect really excited me to develop this project. Here, I learned how to apply 2D images over 3D shapes using decals and many more things like the positioning of 3D models and playing with their placement and tilt effects. This entire experience has been amazing, and my tutor played a huge role in helping me learn and overcome challenges.
